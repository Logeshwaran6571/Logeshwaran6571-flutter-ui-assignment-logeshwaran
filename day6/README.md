## Day 6 – Typography & Code Structure Improvements

## What Was Done

- Updated the application to use the correct and consistent font family across all text elements.

- Refactored deeply nested UI code into well-structured, reusable widget files.

- Improved overall project structure by separating concerns instead of dumping everything into a single file.

## What I Learned

- How to import, configure, and apply custom font families correctly within the project.

- How restructuring widgets improves code readability, maintainability, and makes future changes significantly easier and safer.
