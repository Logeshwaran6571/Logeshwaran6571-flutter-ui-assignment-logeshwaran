## Day 4 – Workout App UI Enhancements

## What I Did

- Built a custom widget for the first exercise card using a Container to control layout, spacing, and background styling.

- Improved the second exercise card by correcting existing widgets, fixing structural issues, and cleaning up the layout with proper Row and Container usage.

## What I Learned

- Gained a clearer understanding of when and how to use Container for padding, margins, decoration, and alignment.

- Improved practical knowledge of Row and Column, including how they handle children, spacing, and layout constraints.

- Learned how to style widgets more effectively using Container decoration, colors, and rounded corners to create cleaner UI components.
