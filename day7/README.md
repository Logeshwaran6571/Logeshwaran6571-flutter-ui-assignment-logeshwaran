## Day 7 –  Fitting Icons and design

## What Was Done

- Implemented a custom progress ring positioned at the center of the main widget layout.

- Replaced some icons with custom icon assets.

- Finally completely done the Task/Assignment.

## What I Learned

- How to integrate and use custom icons and apply consistent text styling across widgets.

- Practical usage of CustomPainter in project.


# Meeting Task completion

- Task 1 -> Make my column as `ListView`done.
 
- Task 2 -> Make Changes in CustomPainter(Arc) done and then `reset` that changes for original output.

- Task 3 -> Create edit icon as `button`, then added functionality(`toggle`: when click that button  `hide and visible`the run `icon` in another widget).
