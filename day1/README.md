# Day 1 - Top Header UI

## What I did
- Created `day1` Flutter project.
- Set up `google_fonts` package for custom fonts.
- Designed the main screen container with rounded corners and light background.
- Implemented the top bar (back button + pill with three icons).
- Implemented the "Workout / 90 min" header with mini bar chart on the right.

## Issues I faced
- pubspec.yaml indentation error when adding `google_fonts`.

## What I learned
- How to customize theme and text using `GoogleFonts`.
- How to use `Row`, `Column`, `Spacer`, `Container`, and `BoxDecoration` for layout.
- How to structure UI into small widgets like `TopBar`, `WorkoutHeader`, `_StatBar`.
