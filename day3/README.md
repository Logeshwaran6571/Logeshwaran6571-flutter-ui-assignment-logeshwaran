## Day 3 – Workout App UI Enhancements

## What I did

- Connected  three  icons from the existing Design and integrated them properly into the layout.

- Applied correct padding, margin, and spacing to ensure each icon aligns cleanly with the design.

- Improved the `overall design` of the Workout widget, enhancing structure and visual balance.

- Completed the `Exercise widget` with the right colors, styling, and layout structure to match the expected UI.


## What I learned

- Gained practical understanding of building layouts using Container, Row, and Column effectively.

- Learned how `classes` and `methods` interact in Flutter and how to structure widgets cleanly.

- Implemented `callback functions` and understood how to return widgets dynamically.

- Strengthened knowledge in spacing and layout fundamentals:

- `padding`,`margin`, `SizedBox`, `Spacer`, `child vs. children`, etc.
