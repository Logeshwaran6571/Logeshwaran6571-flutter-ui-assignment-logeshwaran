## Day 2 - Workout Screen UI

## What I did

- Built the complete `workout screen layout` in workout_screen.dart.

- Implemented the multi-ring circular progress indicator using CustomPainter.

- Added the `Exercise header section` showing Exercise 1/8 and the workout timer.

- Displayed `VO₂` and `heart-rate stats` under the progress ring.

- Created the `STOP button section` with rounded styling.

- Built the Bench Press exercise card with reps, percentage change, time, and play button.

- Organized UI components into reusable widgets (multi_ring_progress.dart, exercise_item.dart, etc.).


## What I learned

- How to break complex UI into `reusable Flutter widgets`.

- How to structure a full screen layout using proper composition.

- How to improve design accuracy with consistent `alignment`, `spacing`, and `padding`.
